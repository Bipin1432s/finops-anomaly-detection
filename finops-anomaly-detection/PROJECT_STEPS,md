# 📘 FinOps Anomaly Detection – Project Implementation Guide

This document explains the **step-by-step process** followed to build and deploy the **FinOps Anomaly Detection Serverless Web Application** on AWS.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how cloud cost anomalies can be detected, stored, and alerted using a fully serverless architecture.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary
The FinOps Anomaly Detection project is a cloud-based system that allows users to trigger a cost analysis from a web interface. The backend analyzes cost data, detects anomalies based on threshold logic, stores the results, and sends alerts when abnormal spending is detected.

This project follows **FinOps principles** such as cost visibility, monitoring, and proactive alerting.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Implementation

---

## ✅ Step 1: Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Created a simple web interface with a **Run Cost Analysis** button.
- Implemented JavaScript `fetch()` to call the backend API.
- Displayed analysis results dynamically on the webpage.

**Purpose:**  
To provide a user-friendly interface for triggering cost analysis.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Host Frontend on Amazon S3
- Created an S3 bucket.
- Enabled **Static Website Hosting**.
- Uploaded frontend files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

**Purpose:**  
To host the frontend without managing any servers.

---

## ✅ Step 3: Enable HTTPS & Mobile Support using CloudFront
- Created a CloudFront distribution with S3 as the origin.
- Enabled **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**.
- Used the CloudFront URL as the final website link.

**Purpose:**  
To make the application accessible on all devices (desktop & mobile) securely.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Create Backend Logic using AWS Lambda
- Implemented a Lambda function (`FinOpsCostAnalyzer`).
- Added anomaly detection logic using historical and current cost comparison.
- Converted numeric values to `Decimal` for DynamoDB compatibility.

**Purpose:**  
To perform serverless cost analysis and anomaly detection.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Create API using Amazon API Gateway
- Created an HTTP API.
- Added a `/run` endpoint integrated with the Lambda function.
- Enabled CORS for frontend communication.

**Purpose:**  
To expose the Lambda function securely to the frontend.

---

## ✅ Step 6: Store Results in Amazon DynamoDB
- Created a DynamoDB table (`FinOps_Anomalies`).
- Stored analysis results such as date, costs, percentage increase, and anomaly status.

**Purpose:**  
To maintain a history of cost analysis results for auditing and review.

---

## ✅ Step 7: Configure Email Alerts using Amazon SNS
- Created an SNS topic.
- Subscribed an email endpoint.
- Triggered alerts when anomaly threshold was exceeded.

**Purpose:**  
To notify stakeholders immediately when abnormal spending is detected.

---

## ✅ Step 8: Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
- Used CloudWatch Logs to monitor Lambda executions.
- Helped debug API and backend issues.

**Purpose:**  
To ensure observability and operational visibility.

---

## 🧠 Anomaly Detection Logic (Simple Explanation)
1. Take historical daily costs.
2. Calculate the average cost.
3. Compare today’s cost with the average.
4. If the percentage increase exceeds **30%**, mark it as an anomaly.
5. Store the result and send an alert if needed.

---

## 🔐 Security & Cost Considerations
- Fully serverless (no EC2).
- HTTPS enabled using CloudFront.
- No AWS WAF to avoid extra costs.
- IAM roles follow least-privilege access.
- Designed to run within AWS Free Tier.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Integrate real AWS billing data using Cost Explorer.
- Add graphical dashboards (charts).
- Implement user authentication.
- Add advanced anomaly detection algorithms.

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with AWS serverless services.
- Practical understanding of FinOps concepts.
- Solved real-world issues like CORS, HTTPS, and DynamoDB data types.
- Designed and deployed a complete cloud application.

---

## 📌 Note
This project is implemented for **learning and demonstration purposes**.  
The architecture is scalable and can be extended for production use.
